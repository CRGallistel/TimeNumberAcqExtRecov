Before proceeding, you should know:  1) The Id number of the experiment [#]  2) The location of the file containing the Experiment structure      (This should be the Experiment[#].mat file in the Experiment[#] folder)  3) The ID numbers of the currently active subjects        (NB, not their index numbers in the Experiment structure!)  4) The information needed to create the MedPC macro: For each subject        i) The letter that identifies on the LAN the computer that controls            that subject s test environment       ii) The location on that computer s hard drive of the .MPC file            for its protocol (aka the condition, phase, or group for that subject)       iii) The box number (ID # for the test environment for that subject)       iv) The number that identifies that protocol (Protocol 1, 2, etc)  5) Whether each protocol restricts feeding periods to certain intervals         during each 24 hr day and, if so, the event codes that indicate         the starts and ends of those intervals (e.g, StartEarly  StopEarly)  6) The custom data-analysis Matlab function for each protocol in this         session (e.g., MatchingAnalysis.m)  7) The arguments that must be passed to that function       (e.g., TdyPlts,Rows,Format). If unsure, you can use defaults  8) The names of the plots that you want emailed (if unsure,       default is CmPksFds  9) The email addresses of the recipients
